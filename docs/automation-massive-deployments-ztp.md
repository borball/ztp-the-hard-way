# Automation and Massive deployments with ZTP

This topic it's a bit complicated, we have a base already working which is purely based on RHACM and Assisted Installer, this second one is covered by the first part of the documentation on the Connected and Disconnected flows, now it's time to focus on some automations for Day2 tasks (After the SNO deployment).

For that we can follow 2 approaches, here you gonna decide which path is the best for you:

- I will deploy less than ~250 SNO clusters.
- I will deploy more than ~250 SNO clusters.

RHACM has a inner capability which generated an object called "deployable" to monitor the things it manages, for example, think on an application + subscription generated by RHACM, all the objects created by both ones will generate a deployable multiplied by the number of existant clusters managed by RHACM where the App + Sub is acting. That means if this application has inside 30 objects, you will multiply 30 * number of SNOs, and these are the number of objects only generated for this app. This is massive load for ETCD to only manage 1 application, so you have an alternative which is using RHACM + ArgoCD + PolicyGenerator.

We will dive a bit more on both methods in the nexts steps.

- [Automation using RHACM and ArgoCD](automation/rhacm-argocd-automation.md)
